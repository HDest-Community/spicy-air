### Notes
---
- The gas mask can only be found in backpacks. Filters can spawn in the wild.
- Loadout codes are `dsp` and `dsf` for the mask and filter, respectively.
- Configuration codes are:
	- `worn`: Start with the mask on.
	- `lf`: Air in left filter (1-3600).
	- `rf`: Air in right filter (1-3600).
- CVars are:
	- `spicy_breathingvolume [0.0 - 1.0]`: Sets the volume for the breathing sound effect. Set to 0 to disable. 
- Each filter gives you 60 minutes of air. The mask can take up to two filters for a maximum duration of 2 hours.
- All air is toxic except that in secret sectors. If your screen flashes, that's a point of aggro. Put on your mask.
- While the mask is worn, the number on the HUD that would normally indicate amount will indicate if the air is toxic.
- Removing the mask while you still have air will hold your breath for 15 seconds, giving you time to change filters without breathing in deadly toxins.
