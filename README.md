# Spicy Air
_Adds some spice to your demon-infested techbase.  Originally made by Accensus, now maintained by the community._  
_Requires [HDCoreLib](https://github.com/HDest-Community/hdest-core-lib)._

## Mechanics
- While the mask is worn, the number on the HUD that would normally indicate amount will indicate if the air is toxic.
- Removing the mask while you still have air will take up to 10 breaths of air, giving you up to 30 seconds to change filters without breathing in deadly toxins.

## Equipment

### Gas Mask
- The gas mask can only be found in backpacks. Filters can spawn in the wild.
- Loadout codes are `dsp` and `dsf` for the mask and filter, respectively.
- Configuration codes are:
	- `worn`: Start with the mask on.
	- `lf`: Air in left filter (1-1400).
	- `rf`: Air in right filter (1-1400).
- Filters deplete each time you breathe in.
